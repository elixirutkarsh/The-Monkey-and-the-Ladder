# The-Monkey-and-the-Ladder
Problem statement:

A monkey is at the bottom of a 10-step ladder. The monkey can climb 3 steps at a time, but it slips back 2 steps at a time. How many steps must the monkey climb in order to reach the top of the ladder?

Solution:

The monkey must climb 7 steps in order to reach the top of the ladder. This is because the monkey can climb 3 steps at a time, but it slips back 2 steps at a time, so it effectively climbs 1 step each time. Therefore, it will take 7 steps for the monkey to climb 10 steps.
